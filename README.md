## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
Are you tired of the challenges and risks associated with managing contracts and funding in traditional business setups? Have you experienced corruption or misuse of funds in your previous contract-based ventures? If so, we have a solution for you!
Introducing our innovative business contract management platform that leverages Web3 technology to offer secure contract creation and transparent monitoring of funded money flow. With our platform, you can have peace of mind knowing that your contracts are secure and funds are being utilized as intended.
The core problem we aim to address is the inefficiency and lack of transparency in contract management and fund allocation. In traditional business models, contracts often involve multiple parties and financial transactions, making it challenging to ensure fair and secure execution. Corruption and misuse of funds can occur due to lack of oversight and accountability.

## âš™ What it does
- Our platform utilizes the power of the Near blockchain to create smart contracts, which serve as tamper-proof and transparent records of contractual agreements. By leveraging the blockchain, we can ensure the integrity and immutability of contracts, reducing the risks associated with fraud and corruption.
- One of the key features of our platform is the implementation of a multisig wallet between the contractor and the lister. This wallet acts as a secure repository for funds allocated to the contract. Both parties have visibility into the flow of funds, and the lister has the authority to accept or decline fund usage if it appears suspicious. This ensures that the lister maintains control over the funded money and can actively monitor its utilization.
- With our platform, contract participants can enjoy increased trust and transparency in their business dealings. Contractors can have confidence that their work will be compensated appropriately, while listers can have peace of mind knowing that funds will be used responsibly. By combining the security and transparency of blockchain technology with contract management, we aim to revolutionize the way business contracts are created and managed.

## ðŸ›   How we built it


## ðŸ’ªChallenges we ran into
- It is our first time building a complete Dapp on NEAR Protocol as well as working with Rust and Smart Contract writing at first we are unable to understand the working on the same. But we are able to do it after reading documentation or searching more about it.

- Thinking about the project as per the perspective of startup is initially hard for us, but after talking to real user we will be able to do that.

It was hard to make a fully responsive and beautiful UI of Transpact. But we are able to do it because of teamwork.

## ðŸ“Œ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Well, we built a whole social platform that solves a real world problem in 16 hours!! That's the biggest achievement of this hackathon.
- Able to build the platform on Near protocol that really solves the issue.

## ðŸ“š What we learned
- Learned more about NEAR Protocol and writing the revenue model for the platform . Learned a lot more about Rust, Near protocol and team Building.
